# Servershare
Fast filesharing using 3-6 files on your ftp server.

To share files fast:

1. Log in to your FTP.
2. Create folder with a unique name (for some sort of security, use something like www.randomcodegenerator.com for the foldername)
3. Put the files in this Github (excluding readme and license) in your folder
4. Add all files you want to share.
5. Ready to share your link.

You may or may not use the textures for the background. They take just 12mb of space and are randomly loaded. It is also possible tot use your own by renaming your jpg's texture1, texture2 and texture3.
