Fast filesharing using 3-6 files on your ftp server.

To share files fast:

1. Log in to your FTP.
2. Create folder with a unique name (for some sort of security, use something like www.randomcodegenerator.com for the foldername)
3. Put the files in this Github in your folder
4. Add all files you want to share.
5. Ready to share your link.
